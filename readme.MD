# Hello World for Python Study Group A.K.A. Python Jedis

This is a standard Hello World program. It defines a function **hello(subject)**. The subject argument is whatever you are saying 'Hello' to.

Usage Example:
```python
hello("Jedis!")

# Output
# Hello Jedis!
```

Furthermore, please treat this repository as a sandbox. Fork it, Branch it, Clone it, Push to it, do whatever you want to. This is for learning git, being quirky, and writing hello world. That is my only request, whatever you do, make the program output some form "Hello Something". Use crazy list comprehensions, do it in binary, go wild!
